### ðŸ“Œ Steps to Use:

1. **Create a repository** named exactly `ManavTheGoat` (must match your username).
2. **Add a `README.md`** file and paste the content above.
3. **Customize** your LinkedIn, YouTube, or email links.
4. Optionally, add your own `.gif`, `.png`, or SVG illustrations for extra flair!

Let me know if you'd like to add dynamic features like:
- Visitors counter  
- Latest blog or video embeds  
- Contribution graph calendar  
- Badge for GATE/GRE/YouTube journey

Want a **dark-themed version** or animated icons? I can make that too!
